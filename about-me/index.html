	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>I'm a Software engineer and Family guy living in Utah.  I have a degree in computer science from Utah State, and am currently working at OC Tanner.  I enjoy my work [usually].  Most of the code I've written is server side code, so I'm working on improving my skills as a front end developer.</p>

	<p>I like building things and making things work. Software is sort of a natural fit here, there's a lot of opportunity to create beautiful and functional things.</p>
